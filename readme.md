This is a mySQL database that is hosted on Heroku using an instance of JawsDB. It allows the user to 'add', 'read all' and 'eat' hamburgers. On the left side of the screen, the Menu displays  user-added Hamburgers. When the user clicks the 'eat' button of a Hamburger, the hamburger status changes to 'eaten' and is moved to the right column where all the 'eaten' hamburges are displayed. All the data persists in Heroku.
